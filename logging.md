### Linux System Logs
Linux has a special directory for storing logs called `/var/log.`
* `var/log/syslog` and `/var/log/messages` store all global system activity data, including startup messages. Debian-based systems like Ubuntu store this in `/var/log/syslog`, while Red Hat-based systems like RHEL or CentOS use `/var/log/messages`.

* `/var/log/auth.log` and /var/log/secure store all security-related events such as logins, root user actions, and output from pluggable authentication modules (PAM). Ubuntu and Debian use `/var/log/auth.log`, while Red Hat and CentOS use `/var/log/secure`.

* `/var/log/kern.log` stores kernel events, errors, and warning logs, which are particularly helpful for troubleshooting custom kernels.
* `/var/log/cron` stores information about scheduled tasks (cron jobs). Use this data to verify that your cron jobs are running successfully.

## Analyzing

* `grep "user hoover" /var/log/auth.log` - plain grep

* Surround Search - Using surround search returns a number of lines before or after a match. This provides context for each event by letting you trace the events that led up to or immediately followed the event. The `-B` flag specifies how many lines to return before the event, and the `-A` flag specifies the number of lines after.
	* `grep -B 3 -A 2 'Invalid user' /var/log/auth.log`

* `grep -B 3 -A 2 'Invalid user' /var/log/auth.log` - using tail and grep in combination to search for a specific tool.

* One of the most common things people want to see in their logs are errors. Unfortunately, the default syslog configuration doesnâ€™t output the severity of errors directly, making it difficult to filter on them.There are two ways you can solve this problem. First, you can modify your rsyslog configuration in `/etc/rsyslog.conf`. with:
	* `"<%pri-text%> : %timegenerated%,%HOSTNAME%,%syslogtag%,%msg%n"`
* Second use awk:
	* `awk '/.err>/ {print}' /var/log/auth.log`
